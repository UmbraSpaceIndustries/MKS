Modular Kolonization System (MKS) 
===

This is the repository for the MKS and OKS mods for [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)

MKS and OKS are the original works of RoverDude (GitHub user BobPalmer).  

You can find the official repo for this mod on [Github](http://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS).  Releases, along with other USI products, can be found on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1fsuzvl35s2gppt/AAD8kNgBm6rO9m4paXmwuqA0a). 


NOTE:  0.18 is a BREAKING change for 0.17 users.  Also, most docs on Github are still being updated to reflect the new changes - be patient :)
