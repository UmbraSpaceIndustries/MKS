Modular Kolonization System (MKS) 
===

This is the repository for the MKS and OKS mods for [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)

MKS and OKS are the original works of RoverDude (GitHub user BobPalmer).  

You can find the official repo for this mod on [Github](https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS).  Releases, along with other USI products, can be found on [the USI Catalog Page](https://umbraspaceindustries.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/). 

### Supported Mods
(MKS includes additional functionality when these mods are present)

* [USI Life Support](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116790)
* [TAC Life Support](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667?p=1382515&viewfull=1#post1382515)
* [Snacks](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841) via the [E-Z Snack Oven](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92309)
* [Extraplanetary Launchpads](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545)

NOTE:  For Life Support Mods (USI, TAC, or Snacks!) it is recommended you only pick one!  USI-LS is the default, and will afford the most support and integration, but TAC-LS and Snacks! are also fully supported.
