From mhoram:
- Added a helpful pull request note to the readme
From pjwerneck:
- Fixed texture issue on PDU
From fmatosqg:
- Fixed typos in drill descriptions
From smjjames:
- Added radiator recommendations to descriptions in USI-ReactorNFE
Other changes:
- KSP 1.0.5 compatibility
- Broke out separate category tabs for MKS-LITe vs UKS

0.31.11.2 - 2015.10.18
--------------------
Fixed KIS config of the anchor hub

0.31.11.1 - 2015.10.18
----------------------
Quick patch to fix the attachment nodes on the anchor hub

0.31.11 - 2015.10.16
--------------------
From Mhoram:
- Fixed several typos
- Made fertilizer available in the OKS ILMs
- Take TAC-LS resource consumption into account when displaying base stats
From Seb E:
- Fixed issue with efficiency part as root part
From Jberkman
- Fixed several typos 
Other changes:
- Update core dependencies (USICore/MM)
- Inflatable Workshop now requires only one Kerbal to operate for OSE Workshop
- Removed Kontainers from CTT config as these are now part of USICore
- Updated tube, ISM, and anchor models (less explodey)
- Lowered KIS volume of various components
- Replaced DepletedUranium with DepletedFuel


0.31.10 - 2015.09.22
--------------------
All Kontainers and mini-ILMs are now EVA repaintable
Added numeric decals to the mini ILM to aid in repainting
Added a handy KIS 'saddle bag' to Kontainers, hods 500L
Converted Kontainer images to DDS
Added alternate nodes to the rigid tube to better connect with ball hubs, etc.
Added a new anchor hub - this small hub is KIS storable, can be anchored to the ground, and works very well if you want to make a base with 100% KIS components (this would be your root part)
Adjusted the regolith sifter - the resource threshold has been removed at the expense of efficiency, making this a much more viable first harvesting part.
Adjusted several colliders to add a bit more leeway for ground contact
Added 6-way station hub (thanks Enceos!)



0.31.9 - 2015.09.21
-------------------
Adjusted Duna Module collider to allow for easier selection of crew hatch
Correctly moved the OKS PDU to Legacy
Lowered mass and cost of the Mk-V ILM
Corrected missing decals on the Duna base module

0.31.8 - 2015.09.19
-------------------
More community fixes!

Fom Gnurfos:
- Allow EPL workshops to drain RocketParts through logistics
- Minor fix to the description of MK3 refinery

From mhoram:
- Fix small issues with rover logistics
- Add ModuleFieldRepair to nukes to enable Maintenance

And other fixes!
- Corected hatches and colliders on MKS Module
- Fixed ModuleBase feet
- Fixed missing light animations for inflatable parts
- Added light emmissive to docking port
- Changed demo block's context menus to avoid confusion
- Added box collider to the bubble hub
- Reduced drill mass to be inline with stock
- The Akademy is now a lot heavier - 6.5 tons - since most modules get their weight from added machinery.
- Separated senders and receivers for power generation.  A PowerDistributor can distribute power via a PowerCoupler.  Both have separate ranges and can be on the same part.
- The Power pack is a short range PowerDistributor and PowerCoupler.  So it can power up devices within 500m.
- The (new) PDU also has both PowerDistributor and PowerCoupler capabilities, but has a very long distribution range (15km).  PDUs should be the 'Hub' in a hub and spoke base design.  It als takes on the centrifuge and breeder functions of the fuel refinery.
- THE MKS AND OKS PDU MODULES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LEGACY AND WILL BE DEPRECATED WITH KSP 1.1
- Separated logistics from MKS efficiency, so you can now easily have parts that are not MKS modules subscribe to rover logistics and power distribution.  This module is added to all MKS modules and stock drills.

0.31.7 - 2015.09.17
-------------------
First off - a ton of community fixes in this one.  Thanks so much for helping out!

- Updated the OctoLander's Connected Living Space config
- Created Connected Living Space configs for the Mk-V modules
- Removed references to no longer existing parts
- Fixed an issue with the OctoLander CoM offset
- Correct inconsistent FSFuelSwitch mass definitions.
- Updates to the Resource Overview
- Adjust Recyclables DumpExcess behaviour for TAC-LS
- Remove Rover Logistics Resource Oscillation

Fixes and Updates from geoffromer:

- Added transfer time display to the new transfer window
- Fix typos in logic for determining source and destination situations.
- Fixed radian conversion bug in Orbital Logistics

Fixes from fmatosqg:
- Fix TAC-LS file for MKV: needed machinery must match available space

Fixes from Kerbas-ad-astra:
- Corrected bunlkeadProfiles

I did a few things too :)
- Updated USI Tools version
- Added a new 'demolition pack' part, that allows you to destroy whole vessels, sub-trees of parts, or arbitrarily destroy any part.  KIS compatible.
- Added a new set of nuclear reactors in 0.625/1.25/2.5/3.75 form factors.  HELP WANTED:  I would love to see a pull request with an MM config for NFE!
- Added alternate configs for OSE Workshop that utilizes MKS style chains, and adds workshop capabilities to both the Mk-V and Mk-III workshops.
- The Logistics Rover now has emissive effects
- The original Mk-II Aeroponics, Kerbitat, and Pioneer modules have been replaced by the slick new 'Duna' series modules (I'll be deprecating the Mk-x designations over time because they are a bit confusing).  This newer module is meant to stack in-line with the Karibou, or be used *without* a module base.  The radial nodes are dual-sized, one for connecting to other parts, and an inset node for accepting Mk-V modules.  The Duna series modules can be put in a 3.75m fairing either horizontally or vertically!  This module also has dual flag transforms, and the floodlights (four light sources) have been replaced with a single light source to help reduce lag.
- The Bahamuto style drills have been replaced with reskinned stock drills.  NOTE!!! THIS WILL CAUSE SHIPS WITH THE OLD DRILLS TO LEAP INTO THE AIR!!! DETACH OLD DRILLS OR HILARITY MAY ENSUE!
- All of the MK-V inflatables now light up!
- Modified the Module and Mobile base parts to be compatible with the Duna series modules.

  considered when looking for resources to store or retrieve.
